# Video Player Liquid Glass

This is an experimental study applying liquid glass effects to a video player UI inspired by Apple’s new design system. It’s built using layered divs to mimic the glass layers showcased in Apple’s keynote, aiming to create a frosted glass and liquid distortion feel.

Icons are from **SF Symbols beta 7**. The effect uses CSS `backdrop-filter` combined with SVG turbulence filters to simulate liquid glass refraction.

**Note:** This is just a test and far from matching Apple’s polished results. The main challenge is that using Canvas or WebGL practically in real websites and systems is often unfeasible. This project is one of many studies I’m doing to emulate the effect.
